# StudentLoanApp
A web app analyzing student loan debt data developed with R shiny.

The plots are based on data from the Survey of Consumer Finances. Loan amounts are the total student loan debt held by the household. Demographic information is for the survey respondent and may not be the same person/people for which the student loans were taken out. The final bar of the histogram shows individuals with debt at that level and higher. Percents are out of all households with student loans. If the ratio of loan payment to income is zero, this may indicate the household has loan payments temporarily deferred or in forebearance.
